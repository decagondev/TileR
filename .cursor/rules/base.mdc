# TileR Core Principles

## SOLID Principles Enforcement

### Single Responsibility
- Each component should have one clear purpose
- Canvas components handle only rendering, not state management
- State management lives in separate hooks (e.g., `useTiles`, `useCanvas`)
- Storage logic is abstracted in dedicated modules

### Open-Closed
- Tools should be extensible via plugin pattern
- Canvas rendering decoupled from UI state
- Export formats can be added without modifying core logic
- Components accept props for customization, not hardcoded behavior

### Dependency Inversion
- Components depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Storage abstraction allows swapping IndexedDB implementation
- Use dependency injection for testability

## Modular Design Requirements

- Feature-based organization: `/src/features/tiles`, `/src/features/map`, `/src/features/projects`
- Shared utilities in `/src/utils/` or `/src/lib/`
- Reusable UI components in `/src/components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components in their respective feature folders

## No Breaking Changes Policy

- Build atop existing starter codebase without altering core config
- Do not modify `index.html` or `vite.config.ts` structure unnecessarily
- Preserve existing chatbot infrastructure for future repurposing
- All additions should be additive, not destructive

## Code Quality Standards

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Avoid global state for MVP (use Zustand or Context + Reducer if needed)
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Keep functions small and focused

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize canvas redraws (only affected regions)
- Debounce expensive operations (auto-save, etc.)
- Limit map dimensions (256x256 max for MVP)
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
